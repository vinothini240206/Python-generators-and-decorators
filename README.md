### **Introduction to Decorators and Generators**

**Decorators** in Python are a powerful tool that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code. By using decorators, you can add functionality to existing code in a clean and reusable way, such as logging, access control, or measuring execution time.

**Generators** are a special type of iterator in Python that allows you to iterate over data without storing the entire sequence in memory. They are defined using the `yield` keyword, which returns an item and pauses the function, resuming when the next value is requested. Generators are crucial for handling large data sets efficiently and creating pipelines for processing data on-the-fly.

Both decorators and generators are important in Python programming because they promote cleaner, more efficient, and reusable code. Decorators help in extending the functionality of functions or classes in a modular way, while generators enable memory-efficient data processing and iteration, making them essential tools for writing robust and scalable Python programs.
